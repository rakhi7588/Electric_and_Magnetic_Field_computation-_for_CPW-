# Electric_and_Magnetic_Field_computation-_for_CPW-
Analytical electromagnetic field solver for coplanar waveguides (CPW) based on Rainee Simons' formulas. Computes electric (E) and magnetic (H) field components in air and substrate regions using modal expansion. Visualizes field line distributions across the CPW cross-section with streamline plots.
